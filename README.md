# Smart Contract Verfication system using Dafny

Developed a command line application that verifies the smart contract using static verification to ensure bug free contracts. Contracts will be parsed using ANTLR which will generate the parse tree which will be further translated to another programming language called Dafny as it supports formal verification, using Python.
