# Smart Contract Verfication system using Dafny

Developed a command line application that verifies the smart contract using static verification to ensure bug free contracts. Contracts will be parsed using ANTLR which will generate the parse tree which will be further translated to another programming language called Dafny as it supports formal verification, using Python.


## Smart Contracts:

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.
